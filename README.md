# DifferentialDriveRobot_FK
[Part I]
app1 - is the first exercise;
>>TO RUN: 
1)open file, run it from matlab. 
2)In the new windows change the values of initial position and orientation, set up light source to be in range x: [0,200], y: [0, 100]
3)Push the UPLOAD button
4)Change the values of knobs for angular velocities. The model responses dynamically.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT TOGGLE THE ANN SWITCH FOR "On" POSITION
[Part II]
app1v2 - is the second exercise;
>>TO RUN:
1)open file, run it from matlab. 
2)In the new windows change the values of initial position and orientation, set up light source to be in range x: [0,200], y: [0, 100]
3)TOGGLE THE ANN SWITCH FOR "On" POSITION 
IMPORTANT2: DO NOT PUSH THE UPDATE BUTTON;
IMPORTANT2: If the simulation takes too much time, simply remove the pause(1/24) at the end of the app.ANNSWITCH. As the computation completes, you will see the same final picture.
