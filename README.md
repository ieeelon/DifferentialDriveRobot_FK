app1 - is the first exercise;<br/>
>>TO RUN: 
1)open file, run it from matlab.<br/> 
2)In the new windows change the values of initial position and orientation, set up light source to be in range x: [0,200], y: [0, 100]<br/>
3)Push the UPLOAD button<br/>
4)Change the values of knobs for angular velocities. The model responses dynamically.<br/>
IMPORTANT: DO NOT TOGGLE THE ANN SWITCH FOR "On" POSITION<br/>
<br/>
app1v2 - is the second exercise;<br/>
>>TO RUN:
1)open file, run it from matlab.<br/> 
2)In the new windows change the values of initial position and orientation, set up light source to be in range x: [0,200], y: [0, 100]<br/>
3)TOGGLE THE ANN SWITCH FOR "On" POSITION<br/> 
IMPORTANT2: DO NOT PUSH THE UPDATE BUTTON;<br/>
IMPORTANT2: If the simulation takes too much time, simply remove the pause(1/24) at the end of the app.ANNSWITCH. As the computation completes, you will see the same final picture.
